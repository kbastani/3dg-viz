# 3dg-viz

A WebGL distributed graph visualization library.

## About

This project was created to provide a WebGL-based distributed visualization interface designed specifically for graphs.

  What does distributed visualization mean?

Distributed graph visualization is a term I made up to describe the process of a client-based messaging approach utilizing a consumer and producer model. The basic idea is that a Web Worker architecture is used to asynchronously send and receive messages to an application-based broker that renders a 3D scene in a distributed way.
